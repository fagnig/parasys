> How well do you think it removes the noise?
somewhat well, even though it's just a simple blurring filter

>What speedup can you achieve for various numbers of threads/cores (up to the max number of cores available)?
see result.txt

>Also make a graph of the parallel efficiency.

>For one thread what is the efficiency of the OpenMP version? 
bad

>Why is it not close to 100%? 
Thread memory copying overhead

>Explain the form of the efficiency curve.

>First add the clause schedule(static, 500) and run the test script again for different numbers of cores. Explain the results.


>Now do the same for the clauses schedule(static, 1), schedule(dynamic) and schedule(guided).

>Does any of the schduling clauses seem to improve the parallel efficiency?
They all seem to slow it down, as most likely the workload is not big enough.
